# Moria Replication

## What Is This?

**The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria** is a survival and building game set inside the Mines of Moria. Players take on the role of Dwarves returning to reclaim their ancient homeland -- exploring procedurally generated caves, gathering resources, building structures and fortifications, crafting weapons, brewing Dwarven beverages, and fighting off Orcs, Trolls, and other creatures.

This project takes the shipped game and works backward to recreate a working copy of the game's development environment. Think of it like taking a finished book and reconstructing the author's notebook -- not to copy the book, but to write new chapters that fit seamlessly into the story.

**Why does this matter?** The game uses a framework called FGK (Free-range Games Kit) that reads all of its configuration files at startup and locks them into a memory cache. These configuration files (called DataTables) define everything: what items exist, what can be built, what each building piece looks like, what resources are needed. Once the cache is sealed at startup, nothing new can be added.

This means traditional runtime mods (like the companion [MoriaAdvancedBuilder](https://github.com/jbowensii/MoriaAdvancedBuilder) project) can modify existing items but cannot add entirely new entries to the build menu. The FGK cache blocks them.

**The solution:** If new content is packaged the same way the game packages its own content (as cooked IoStore pak files), it gets loaded *before* the cache is built. The game treats it as original content. This is already proven by existing Moria mods (Secrets of Khazad-dum, TobiModsAddons). This project builds the editor environment needed to create, cook, and package that content.

## Project Status -- v0.2.0

### What's Done

| Phase | Status | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| 1. Tool Setup & Extraction | Done | FModel, retoc, KismetKompiler installed; 56,797 game assets extracted |
| 2. Editor Project Generation | Done | UE4.27 project compiles cleanly (9 game modules, 14 fix steps), editor opens |
| 3. Asset Import | Done | 26,139 assets imported into the editor project |
| 4. Blueprint Decompilation | Done | 4,406 Blueprints decompiled to readable .kms pseudocode |
| 5. Level Reconstruction | Done | 86 room layouts reconstructed from BubbleData (292,543 actors total) |

### What's Not Done

| Item | Notes |
|------|-------|
| Materials on meshes | Parent master materials (shader graphs) can't be reconstructed from cooked data -- meshes show as gray/white |
| Procedural cave geometry | Cave walls/ceilings are generated at runtime by the game's voxel system, not stored as files |
| Blueprint editing | Decompiled to pseudocode for reading, but visual graph data is stripped during cooking |
| Play in editor | No player character, no game mode configured -- levels are view-only |
| Cook and package mods | Editor compiles but cooking to IoStore paks has not been attempted |
| 7 bow/crossbow animations | Extra prop bones not in base Dwarf skeleton |
| 12 Troll AnimMontages | JsonAsAsset can't resolve `.6` object index skeleton references |

### Asset Import Breakdown

| Asset Type | Count | Method |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| Textures | 2,806 | JsonAsAsset + Cloud Server |
| Materials & Material Instances | ~3,000+ | JsonAsAsset + Cloud Server |
| Data Tables, Curves, Sound Data | ~5,500+ | JsonAsAsset + Cloud Server |
| Static Meshes | 2,027 | UModel > Blender > FBX > UE4 (100% coverage) |
| Skeletal + Destructible Meshes | 1,322 | Copied from cooked game files |
| Animations (FBX) | 4,018 | PSA > Blender FBX conversion > UE4 import |
| Animations (cooked) | 4 | Troll AnimSequences copied from cooked files |
| Blueprints (cooked, view-only) | 4,406 | retoc IoStore-to-legacy conversion |
| Level maps (.umap) | ~200+ | retoc IoStore-to-legacy conversion |
| **Total** | **26,139** | |

| Custom UI widgets | Widget Blueprints in the UMG visual designer |
| New Blueprint actors | Full Blueprint creation referencing game classes |

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- **UE4.27 Editor** installed at `C:\Program Files\Epic Games\UE_4.27\`
- **Visual Studio 2022** with C++ game development workload
- **Python 3.10+** for automation scripts
- **Blender 3.x+** for mesh and animation conversion
- **Windows 10/11 x64**
- **Git with Git LFS** (binary assets are stored via LFS)

### Open the Editor
1. Double-click `scripts/Moria Editor.lnk` (or copy to your Desktop)
2. If prompted "Missing modules -- rebuild?", click **Yes**
3. If prompted about new plugins, click **Dismiss**
4. Expected warning: `DefaultMediaTexture` missing -- harmless

### Build from Command Line
```batch
"C:\Program Files\Epic Games\UE_4.27\Engine\Binaries\DotNET\UnrealBuildTool.exe" ^
  MoriaEditor Win64 Development ^
  -Project="<repo>\project\Moria.uproject"
```

## How the Pipelines Work

### Asset Import Pipeline (JsonAsAsset)
The primary import tool is JsonAsAsset, a UE4 editor plugin that reads JSON exports from FModel and reconstructs native .uasset files. A companion Cloud Server (localhost:1500) provides automatic dependency resolution -- when a material references a texture, the server provides the texture data so both import together.

```
FModel (JSON export) --> Cloud Server (dependency resolution) --> JsonAsAsset plugin (UE4 import)
```

The `batch_import.py` script orchestrates this: splitting 27,313 JSON exports into small batches, running the UE4 commandlet on each, catching crashes, and resuming automatically.

### Mesh Import Pipeline (UModel > Blender > UE4)
Meshes require a three-phase pipeline because JsonAsAsset only imports metadata, not geometry:

```
UModel (export glTF from paks) --> Blender (convert glTF to FBX) --> UE4 Editor (import FBX)
```

The `mesh_import.py` script runs all three phases. Result: 2,027/2,027 static meshes (100% coverage).

### Animation Pipeline (PSA > Blender > UE4)
Animations are exported as PSA files, converted to FBX via Blender with explicit skeleton mapping, and imported into UE4:

```
PSA files --> Blender (PSA to FBX) --> UE4 Python console (ue4_anim_fbx_import.py)
```

Result: 4,018 animations imported. 7 bow/crossbow animations failed (extra prop bones).

### Blueprint Decompilation Pipeline
Blueprints are compiled bytecode -- we can't reconstruct the visual editor graphs, but we can decompile them to readable pseudocode:

```
IoStore .uasset --> retoc (convert to legacy format) --> KismetKompiler (decompile to .kms)
```

Result: 4,406 Blueprints decompiled at 100% success rate. Output in `decompiled/`.

### Level Reconstruction Pipeline
The game's rooms ("bubbles") are defined by MorBubbleData assets. We export these as JSON via FModel, then generate UE4 Python scripts that reconstruct each room:

```
BubbleData JSON --> reconstruct_level.py --> UE4 Python script --> Edit > Execute Python Script
```

Three phases per room: (1) static mesh placement, (2) construction blocks via DecoVolume transforms, (3) breakable objects and deco markers. Key discovery: construction blocks have NO transforms of their own -- position data comes from matching DecoVolume names.

Result: 86 rooms, 292,543 actors total. Pre-generated scripts in `scripts/reconstructed/`.

## Scripts Guide

All scripts live in `scripts/` and are run from a terminal. Most have a `--run` flag -- without it, they do a dry run.

### Phase 1 -- Extraction

## What Worked and What Didn't

### Worked Well
- **JsonAsAsset + Cloud Server** -- Reliable for textures, materials, data tables, curves. Dependency resolution handled complex material chains automatically.
- **UModel mesh export** -- Clean glTF output, 100% mesh coverage through the Blender FBX pipeline.
- **KismetKompiler** -- 100% success rate decompiling 4,406 Blueprints.
- **BubbleData reconstruction** -- Key breakthrough: ConstructionCatalog blocks get positions from matching DecoVolume names, not their own transforms.
- **PowerShell over os.walk** -- Critical for OneDrive: Get-ChildItem in seconds vs os.walk in minutes.

### Did Not Work
- **Material parent shaders** -- The biggest gap. Shader graphs are compiled to bytecode during cooking and the original node layout is lost. All meshes render gray/white.
- **Blueprint reconstruction** -- Decompilation to pseudocode works, but visual graph data is stripped during cooking. No path to editable Blueprints.
- **Stove with IoStore format** -- Patched for legacy .umap (PR #116), but native IoStore/Zen support needs a full Zen parser.
- **OneDrive + Git** -- Phantom files, circular junctions, and cloud-only files caused friction throughout.
- **Lightmap baking** -- Imported meshes lack dedicated lightmap UVs. Must use dynamic (Movable) lights.

## Known Issues

- **Materials are non-functional** -- All meshes render gray/white. Material Instances have correct parameters but parent shader graphs can't be reconstructed.
- **7 bow/crossbow animations failed** -- Extra prop bones not in base Dwarf skeleton.
- **12 Troll AnimMontages skipped** -- JsonAsAsset `.6` object index limitation.
- **Lightmap UV overlaps** -- Use Movable (dynamic) lights, don't bake lighting.
- **OneDrive performance** -- Use PowerShell `Get-ChildItem`, never `os.walk`. Use `cmd /c rmdir` for junction links.

## Reproducing From Scratch

1. **Phase 1:** Run `extract_game_assets.py` to extract game paks
2. **Phase 2:** Run UE4GameProjectGenerator, then follow `scripts/phase2_fix_compilation.md` (14 fix steps)
3. **Phase 3:** Start Cloud Server, run `batch_import.py --run`, then mesh and animation scripts
4. **Blueprints:** Run `batch_decompile_blueprints.py --run`, then `copy_legacy_blueprints_to_project.py --run`
5. **Levels:** Run `copy_legacy_umaps_to_project.py --run`, then `reconstruct_level.py` per room

## Companion Project

**[MoriaAdvancedBuilder](https://github.com/jbowensii/MoriaAdvancedBuilder)** -- runtime C++ mod via UE4SS DLL injection.

The two projects work together:
- **This project**: Persistent content cooked into IoStore paks (loaded at startup)
- **MoriaAdvancedBuilder**: Runtime behavior via UE4SS (runs while game is playing)
